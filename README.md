# Class-coding-projects
The projects were AVL, HEAP, and ROUTE were done as coding projects given in the advanced data structures class.
The projects were all given skeleton code that was filled and properly coded by me.
Heap.JAVA contains the code to create a minHeap given an array aswell as a heapsort method and extract min function.
Route.JAVA is a project that codes for the shortest flight itinerary using Dijkstra's algorithm as well as the heap class that was coded previously
AVL.JAVA creates an AVL tree given a list of nodes.
